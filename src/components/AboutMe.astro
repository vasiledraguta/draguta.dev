    i'm a software engineer currently in my third year studying computer science
    at bbu. i'm looking for opportunities to work with people who care about
    building things that matter.

    started programming because i wanted to take things apart and see how they
    actually work. it wasn't just about the syntax; it was about the way things
    fit together. that drive to understand the 'why' is still what keeps me
    building today.
